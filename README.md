##### 1. Overview
Application consists of two components. First is represented by the service, which is a .NET Framework (4.7.2) Web API 2 written in C#, and the second one represents the client application, which interacts with the service by making requests to the API and consuming the response from API.<br/>
Long story short, the algorithm is a multitude of switches, string appends and recursive calls.

##### 2. Acceptance criteria
**As** a user <br/>
**I want** to submit a number <br/>
**So that** I get the number represented in a sentence

##### 3.Requirements
- The code should build
- Include appropriate automated tests
- The API should be able to convert numbers from 0 to 1,000,000
- The API should be relatively RESTful, and return a JSON response
- The UI does not need to be particularly fancy, but please make it neat and tidy with some demonstration of your abilities with CSS
- Please build the UI using Angular â€“ the version is up to you
- Use whatever .NET or JavaScript libraries you like

To install and run the application, you need to have `npm (node package manager)` installed on your machine. If you already have it, you can skip the next step.<br/>

- **Install node package manager (npm)** <br/>
To install `npm` you have to access the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the appropiate version for your environment.<br/>

Open a `cmd` window and navigate to the `NumbersToWordsConverter.Client\client-app\` folder. <br/>
Run `npm install` and wait 'til the process finishes.<br/>
If everything installed successfully, you can run the app by typing `ng serve`. When the build is over, the app should be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.
